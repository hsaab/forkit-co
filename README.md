# Fork It Official Website

This is the official website of Fork It, a mobile application built on React Native, which helps users decide what to do when they hangout with their friends

# Key Features

1) Frontend communicates with [backend](https://github.com/hsaab/fkit-signups) (Heroku server and Postgres) database to allow those interested in the app to sign up for updates

2) Utilized [reactstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactstrap), [swiper](https://github.com/kidjp85/react-id-swiper), [scroll-to-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-to-component), among others as key frameworks

3) The video on the home page was created by me to illustrate the different types of experiences the app would provide

You can visit the official website at [Fork It](https://forkit.co). Please be patient as it loads and as you test the "sign up for updates" button, as the website runs on a free Heroku server!
