          The founders met during a hackathon and came up with the idea to create a decision making app for
          indecisive people. This idea later developed into Fork It, a social application which brings friends
          together to embark on end-to-end spontaneous experiences. Our application 'gamifies' the entire planning process
          to make choosing the date, time, group and activity into an enjoyable, instantaneous experience. Lastly, a variety of third-party
          integrations, including Uber, Lyft and Google ensure that users can get to any experiences with just the click of a button.
